have on the top - 2 rows they start with 7 places in each and go to 9
the middle place for putting the boxes - starts are 5 and grows to 7.
the bottom - has potential grid of 8*7
boxes show their contents if they are not blocked to reach the top line. 
only the front row shows its contents.

there are hidden start color boxes
there are pipes that generate multiple boxes on the same location 
they are behind the slot  


i am making a new unity game, i want you to build for me a Unity editor script that will help me
build levels, i want an editor script that will not use any scritable objects.
instead the levels are saved to json files.

the game is as follows, there are color coded boxes (color is int), each box comes with 3 cards inside, 
the cards are also color coded with the same indexes.

there are 8*7 potential slots to have boxes placed on them.
a box can be played if its not blocked all the way to the top row.
so if we have a grid of 3*3 - only they top row boxes can be played - assume that the box in 1,0 was played, 
now also the box at 1,1 can be played.

in addition to the 8*7 grid of potential box positions there are a couple of extra elements.

when you click on an unlocked box it goes to a middle area in the game, this middle area start with 5 slots
and gradually adds more slots - up to 7.
if all the slots are full - you cannot play a box to go there.

when a box was played to the middle part, its contents (the 3 color coded cards) move to a third location - top most 
location - this one starts with 2 rows - each having 7 places, and it gradually grows to 2 rows with 9 places.

this gradual grow happens across levels - and not in a level.

once a box was played to middle - its contents moved to the slots on top, the next part starts, the cards based on their color will now move
from the top part to the boxes in the middle, based on their color, once a box is filled with 3 cards of the matching color - 
the box disappear and its slot is emptied.

this is the game.

before we do anything - do you understand the game? do you have any questions? 


Questions before I start scripting:

How do you want to specify the per-level growth of middle slots and top-area columns? (e.g. an integer in the JSON for “middleMaxSlots” and “topColumns”?)

For positioning, do you have fixed world-space coordinates for grid/middle/top slots, or should the editor calculate them based on a RectTransform area?

Any naming conventions or metadata you’d like in the JSON (level name, seed for random box colors, color-palette definitions)?

Should the editor preview “blocked/unblocked” state visually (e.g. grey out locked boxes)?

Let me know, and I’ll draft the editor script outline.

1. in the grid area, when the boxes start, they typically will have cards of different colors than the box
 - so when it goes to the middle - the cards go out - and other cards with the right color come back to fill the box
 - once its full - its gone.
 
How do you want to specify the per-level growth of middle slots - we should have in the per level data the current number of middle slots.

for positioning - i want the grid to be at the bottom of the UI of the editor script.
i dont care about naming convention at the moment.
editor doesnt need to show blocked/unblocked - 
but later we will build a simulator to play the game - so i am explaining the rules.

in addition - a box can start in a hidden state, meaning i dont see its color until its unlocked.
another feature we need some of the positions on the grid can have instad of a place for a box - a pipe 
a pipe has a number setting and it creates this number of boxes on that grid slot.

before we code anything - can you draft me a data structure to define such level



ok - let's add one more thing to level data - which is the number of top rows.

i want the editor to have load and save from and to json buttons.
i want to have sliders for the following values:
number of colors:2-8.
number of middle slots: 5-7.
number of places in top rows: 7-9.
number of top rows - dont make a slider - keep it as 2 - i am not sure we will change the number of rows.

than i want to see a 8*7 grid, each rect in the grid should be 100*100,
if i left click on a grid rect it should change from exist to not exist.
if it doesnt exist it should be black.

if i right click on a rect, i can change it to say either start hidden, or pipe rect.
if i pick start hidden, it means that whatever box will be on this location, should be marked 
as start hidden.
if i choose pipe, it makes the location above that rect (y+1) holds X number of boxes 
so than on the location i choose to make pipe, you need to put a drop box or text box so i can specify the
quantity.

this means you might need to change the data structure - cause now each grid location 
is not 1 box - but it might be multiple boxes - but this is only if it has a pipe on it.

than i want to have a button to say randomize values:
this now needs to put on all the rects the boxes and their data
the box is a 90*90 rect with color - if i click on that box - it needs to cycle its color.
on each box - i should have 3 small rects, each 25*25 - they also start with a random color, and if clicked should also cycle their color.

to make sure - the pipe sits in a row below the position it really effects.

this seems like everything for the first step, is everything clear? questions before we implement?



few things to modify:

1. when i left click on a rect - it does the exist/not exist - however - when there
is a box above it and i click the box - it doesnt cycle the color - it does the exist/not exist 
and same thing also for clicking the little rects inside the exist/not exist consumes the event.

2. when i select pipe - the cell above it is the cell that holds the pipe boxes, and the pipe cell
should have an editable text box or drop down so i can specify the amount of boxes in the pipe.

give me only the changes



great - everything seems to be working well.
next:
1. i want to visualize also the top and middle parts - 
the top part should show X rows (2) each row should show based on the slider value boxes to visualize place holders for the cards.
2. i want to visualize also the middle part - based on the slider values - show the correct amount of box placeholders 

3. i want to confirm that the grid 0,0 is what i see visually drawn at the top left in the editor window.

give me only the changes 



ok - looks good -

let's make a new helper static class - this will be the entire game logic.

first thing we need to make is a method to say if a box is locked or unlocked.

a box is unlocked if its in top most row or if there is no boxes blocking its path
to the top row - a box can "move" only left/right or up/down - no diagonal.
an empty pipe doesnt block.

method needs to get the level data - and boxID and should say if the box is locked or not locked.

before you implement?
is this crystal clear? its very important to get those things right.


next thing i want to do is make the game loop.
before we do that we need to expand the LevelData class -
need to be able to track which middle slots are full and with whice box.
need to be able to track which top slots are full and with which cards.

this doesnt get filled in the editor script - but only in run time as we start playing.
but since i want to do all the checks and calculations on data - i think we should add this in the LevelData.


ok - let's make the main Game loop,
things can only happen when user clicks a box.

what is most important is that whatever happens we first update the model, even before animation ends
so that model is always updated and user can play very fast.

so when a box is clicked - need to find the first empty slot that we have and move the box there.

when the box gets to the middle - we need to move all its cards to the first free card slot that we have

each card takes one slot - again - we first update the model and only than do any animations.

next thing that happens - we try to fill the empty middle boxes with cards - 
we try to fill boxes before moving on to the next box of the same color - 

if box in the middle got filled with 3 cards (they all should match its color) - the box is cleared.

i want the method to be built in a way so that i can click many boxes fast, so that even before cards flow 
back to an empty box a new one would fly to the middle position.

i am not sure what is the best way to do this - if we update the entire model at the start of the click -
it will already make it so that the cards are moved to middle boxes after being color sorted 
which means all the cards will always go to the first few card slots - cause they would right away be marked 
as empty - so maybe we need to update the model more than once - during the animation?
what do you think? how to support both fast play and keep the system stable?

is everything clear? is my explnation clear?


i want another expansion
i want to make in the level data - the middle slots - i want to have a new dataType - MiddleSlot
it needs to have int unlocks at level.
and maybe we can also give it an ID.
so levelData will have a list<MiddleSlot> instead of middleSlotCount.

for the top i want to have 2 params:
int numberOfRows (2)
int numberOfTopSlotsPerRow - starts at 7 and grows.


looks good - now i want us to build 3 main components:


2. LevelVisualizer - it needs to get LevelData and visualize the level.
needs to have serializedField  for the following:
TopHolder - transform
TopHolderPrefab  - GO
TopSlotPrefab - GO

MiddleHolder - transform
MiddleHolderPrefab -go
MiddleSlotPrefab -go

GridHolder - transform
GridHolderPrefab - go
GridSlotPrefab - go
BoxPrefab - go
PipePrefab - go
CardPrefab - go

than based on the levelData it needs to build the level visually.

it start by cloning TopHolderPrefab and putting it in TopHolder.
than based on number of rows and item per row - clone top slots prefab into the TopHolderPrefab
space them equally on the X axis and take into account have Y number of rows.

than need to do the same for the middle - clone the MiddleHolderPrefab into the MiddleHolder.
and based on number of slots in the list - create middleSlotsPrefabs - put them in the MiddleHolderPrefab and space them on the X.

last - do the grid 
generate all the grid slots (even the ones that dont exist - the view will hide them)
foreach slot - if it exist - it should have a box
so slot than makes its box 
inits the box with the BoxData (box will have a boxview)
if the slot cell is pipe - do same with pipe prefab - and init the PipeView with its relevant data.

after we do this we will init all the cards 

do you think i am leaving something out? makes sense? any questions before we code?
make this in a new class




do you think its better to modify the GridCellView to be able to display Pipe and than remove the PipeView and the PipePrefab?



ok - building seems to work - but all the spaces are completely off.

lets start with Grid - the grid has on it a spriteRenderer - this is the frame of the grid - you can look on the Width and Height of this 
to know the total space you have - than add some vector in the code that will be the size of grid cell - start it at 0.7,0.7 - and ill modify as
needed - than you can calculate the space between all the cells.
i want to remind you that it needs to visualize like it is in the editor- so the first cell (0,0) is the left top most cell

give me fixes


last one is the trickiest - but it follows similar idea.
Top prefab has 2 children - row1 and row2.
each one of them has a SR - for getting its size.
when we clone the top slots - the first row of top slots should go under top/Row1 and the second row in top.Row2.
the rows have TopRowView on them - if you want to use it.

Do you understand? 



ok - this is the initalize of GridCellView

internal void Initialize(GridSlot slot)
{
    //throw new NotImplementedException();
}

let's now give add to it the logic to make create a box or to show as pipe or to show as empty.
you can add whatever serialized fields you want


ok - now we need to do the initialize method of BoxView -
it gets its data - it needs to first color the box itself with its color (for now we will change colors - later we will replace sprites)
and it needs to build and position its cards in place -- and than init the cards
a boxView - can start hidden - so take this to account.

we need to use our helper class to determine if the box is in locked or unlocked 
because this determines if the cards will start show at start or not.

the hidden/not hidden flag determines if the box shows as a ? or if it shows as its color.
for now the hidden can color the box in gray and turn on a GameObeject that is the ?.

for the cards themselves - there is CardSlots under box root - this has 3 children - Slot1/2/3 - they are the places for the cards to 
actually be created into.

you can add any serialized fields needed.

looks good - things seem to be working

now we need to add some more parts before we go to logic:

1. ModelManager - this class (singleton) will hold serializedField reference to List<TextAssets> - the levels data
when init, it reads the files and builds a List<LevelData> - needs to have  amethod to GetLevelByIndex, this one 
needs to make a copy of the level and send back.

2. GameManager - this is where the game start - this will initialize anything that needs initialization (like ModelManager).
after init is done - it needs to get a copy of the current level (by index) from ModelManager
send it to the visualizer for building and than start the game.

make me those 2 classes


this is our current PlayBox method - public void PlayBox(BoxView boxView)
{
    var level = CurrentLevelData;
    var boxData = boxView.Data;

    // 1) Place the box into the middle‐slot model
    int midIndex = level.middleSlotBoxes.FindIndex(b => b == null);
    if (midIndex < 0)
        midIndex = level.middleSlotBoxes.FindIndex(b => b != null && b.resolved);
    if (midIndex < 0)
    {
        //this is not a sure lose - because maybe all the boxes are resolved - but they still didnt arrive 
        
        //if also all the top slots are full 


        //GameOver(false);
        //Debug.Log("Game Over: no free middle slot");

        gridSlot.box = null;


    level.middleSlotBoxes[midIndex] = boxData;

    exitSlot.box = null;

    //end handle pipe


    // 2) Distribute this box’s cards into the top‐slot model
    foreach (var card in boxData.initialCards)
    {

I want to improve a couple of things: 
1. i want the cards assignment to first try to go to boxes that already have some cards on them and not pick the first one based only on index,
it should be first of all the full most one and than index.

2. if a box is played, and 1 or more of its cards already can resolve this box (same color index), we can completly skip the card assignment to top and back
to the box and instead just update the model all the way so it stays in the box.

3. add at the end - after the box is resolved a check for GameOver - if all the middle slots are full and all the boxes in them are not resolved - Game is over.

for all those things give me only the changes
 

 ToDo:
 1. blender - DONE
 2. check game over when trying to put box and no top spaces.------------------------------------  DONE
 3. center the grid based on how many full are in the top X row.------------------------------
 4. index offseter for the colors ------------------------------
 5. fix pipe display and visuals --- DONE
 6. unlocks - comes after the level loads --------------------------------
 7. level5 - data defect -- DONE

 8. need to make it that if you come with a card in your color - it doesnt go out 
 it doesnt need to look for top slot, it is just resolved. ---------------------------------------- DONE

 9. when detecting a game over - need to play the box to the position ???????????????????

 10. need to also detect that there are no space for boxes -----------------------------  DONE

 11. on level 11 - the top slots already become 8 - look on other levels as well and make same ---------------------

 12. consider making grid size cells change based on width and height ????????????????????????????

 13. when you do the cards assignments to boxes - try to first fill boxes that match the color and already have the most assigned to them.-------------------- DONE



 i want to expand another thing in the levelEditor, we now have the color slots - and we can assign colors from the picker.
 i want something little differet - i want to have a list of colors:
 red,green,blue,orange,yellow,pink,purple,white,lightBlue,torquize --- 10 colors
 instead of color picker for each slot of color like we have now - each color slot should have a drop down of the colors list given above.
 so you assign a colorIndex a color from the list.

 than we need to add another method that will get color name from the list and will return a color to match it.

 we first modify this in the editor - later we will expand this also to the game - because i want this cahnge 
 to also be in the game levels - so in level1 color index 0 is red - and in level 2 color index 0 is green.

 understood? clear? 

 give me the changes for editor




 visuals:

 1. start locked box at 0.5Z.
 2. Make cards appear 1 by 1 in the box.
 3. make the flight of box to the middle with Z going up and a full 360 on the X axis.
 4. make the cards fly out in the middle of the box flight and not when reaching the mid slot.
